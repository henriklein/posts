### #2 Favoiurite Film Szenes

> Sci-fi. Sci-fi I’d one of my favourite films Genre. The thing I like most about it how those movies deal with upcoming crises or how our modern daily routine will look like. Movies about the integration of AI in our lifestyle, or Star Track movies about people flinging into deep space and exploring unexplored  inspire me with new ideas and let my imagination go run wild

### #4 Analysing the impact of Film on society

> Products like phones and other accessories are chosen wisely to make an influence on watchers' shopping behavior. But it's not just about products. According to a study of the Harvard university, the eating behaviour of many teens has changed caused by online shows produced by Netflix and other producers. The 'perfect' life, those characters are playing to live, inspires many watchers to adopt the way they see to gain more friens, better health or whatever.

### #6 Specific Job in Media

> ‚ are too many different jobs in this branch. However, I am fascinated by how the cut or the edit of a scene can change the whole meaning and the impact of a movie. Cutters and editors do have really important jobs. Compared to actors, their contribution to the final product is mentioned way less. 

> When I asked strangers to name at least three actors, they were able to. However, less than 10% were able to tell me a relevant editor in this branch. How come? I am most fascinated by special effects. Watching the movie San Andreas, where the Golden Gate Bridge collapsed, they made a whole catastrophic look deceptively real. However, if I didn't know any better, I wouldn't be able to tell that it was fake. Although the job of an editor is as important as the one of an actor, they still earn way less in a movie than an actor such as The Rock. 

### #7 Similarity between North American and European Films

> There are three main differences between those Filmes:

> First of all, North American Movies normally have a way higher budget for production and advertisement, since English is a really common language, and therefore has a bigger audience than for example a german film.

> Secondly, American Movies are in arvage shorter than for example French movies. While North American movies are normally about 1:30 hours, French movies might also take three hour sometimes, since they are focusing more in the dénouement or falling action in a movie.

> Also, a huge different to French movies is that while American movies often focus more on action and the "thrill", French films have less action, but more drama, more dialogue and often follow the same scheme.

### #10 Stereotyping of Characters

> Most modern films are stereotyping Caracters. Don't get me wrong, they are trying to represent all genders or races, but sometimes, the seriousness and intention of a film is suffering under puttet or staged characters. 
>
> Last year i've been acting for a short commercial, what also had a gay cupel in it. The only reason they put them in, was to simulate an open minded company, to gain more interest. 
>
> Stereotyping of characters is often used by moviemakers and producers as a business-module, to gain more impression, clicks or attention from the average person.

### #29 Hoe Social Media and Video influences society
> New, digital Services are great ways to broadcast yourself. Back in the days, the only line of communication was by controlled constitutions, mostly controlled by the government. Now er days, every Person with access’s to the internet is able to not just communicate, but also broadcast them self’s to the public. That is fundamental for a free, liberal society, that is not fully controlled by the Government

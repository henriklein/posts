societys impact and doings against climatic change

## Introduction

It is sweltering outside. It is evident that climate change is real. 2016 has been the hottest year since the starting of measurement in the 1880s. Three out of four of the warmest years since analysis happened in the last century; It doesn't look better for the following years. It seems like some more world records will be broken! People avoid going out. While the temperature increases, Earth is begging us to stop creating a massive Bushfire in Australia. I guess it's for certain that people already smell the hellfire of climate change.

## Comperation

Compared to other years, 2018 claimed the hottest July in history of meteorological observation and contained heatwaves that over rolled not just common areas, but the whole world. Northern regions like Canada, the US, most of Europe and Russia got witnessed by high-temperature records over summer, causing droughts, and therefore agriculture damage. Japan, declaring a natural disaster that killed over 100 citizens. 2018 displays confirmation of climate change and its consequences.



## shifting

The "new normal" is described as an indicator of massive heatwaves that will be resulted ordinary in the future. Scientists predict massive heatwaves and aridities, caused by the high amount of Greenhouse emission exhaled worldwide. As long as Greenhouse emission is governed on a county-based matter, as it is, nothing will change (own interpretation). In order to reduce the Greenhouse Gas output, a worldwide (Gruppe) has to been set in place to determine rules based on facts counting for every country without exception. The CO2 tax that will be set in place in Germany soon is a good start.

##  visualisation

The cartoon shows two men, a fat, sweating person, and an educated doctor. The Doctor is diagnosing the man with having a sunstroke. Having a sunstroke might make you feel dizzy and senseless. The man, "explaining" that the climate change is not real, might be infected by those kinds of symptoms, that make him say irrational and already disapproved theses. Unfortunately, it is not forbidden to broadcast disapproved opinions, so people like politicians apply them to influence third parties that believe in them.

## conclution

Well, first of all, the Idea should not be to adapt but to engage. There is still time to redo actions by lowing down our green gas emission and therefore change not just power, but most of humankind builds machines to emission-free (renewable). Companies like Tesla and others are already working on making society cleaner. If, however, we can't lower our output, because countries can work together this, there are ways too slow the process down. We could spray chemicals in the atmosphere witch still wouldn't solve the problem of reducing the greenhouse emission but would give us an extra approximately 25 years to adjust to renewable energy. Other tech pioneers that already lost faith in Earth try to colonize Mars for Humanity to overdue a complete extinction that isn't unlikely within the next couple of hundred years!

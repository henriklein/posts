What does the GDP stand for and what impact does it have on a certain's lifestyle?

## Basic walkthrough

The GDP reports the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific period of time in a particular country or region. However, GDP per capita does not reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries. Therefore it can not be used to ascertain the quality of life and people's wealth. Its macroeconomic function is to determine the economic development and progress of a specific region and evaluate if the economy is growing or shrinking over time. Between 2005 and 2015, the GDP in Germany grow, on average 1.4 percent YoY. The only outlier was 2009 when the economy shrank by more than 5.6 percent. Nonetheless, since 2018 the development decreases continuously with around 0.1 percent annually.

## What it tells

2.GDP has nothing to say about the level of the quality of living in society. GDP merely measures the size of a nation's economy and doesn't reflect a nation's welfare. GDP includes what is spent on environmental protection, healthcare, and education, but it does not include actual levels of environmental health and learning. It can not be used to ascertain people's average life quality or happiness. It is theoretically possible that while GDP is climbing, the standard of living and Humans' well being could be decreasing since human health, environmental cleanliness, and other factors are not included in GDP.

## problems with usage

3.GDP merely measures the size of a nation's economy and doesn't reflect a nation's welfare and cost of living. GDP could be as outlined above, disconnected. It also does not include the inflation rate and therefore, the purchasing power parity is a better indicator or measurement when comparing differences in living standards between nations.

## alternatives 

W3 indicators have initially been developed to overcome the limitations of the GDP and to support the GDP by adding additional information calculated to determine Humans well being, their quality of life, wealth, distribution of income, biodiversity and life expectancy.

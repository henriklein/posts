## The Idea

> We are trying to create a complete working social media app, that should be released for IOS and Android and later Web. This is possible thanks to a framework from Google called Flutter. It works together with the complete new developed .dart language, which is one of the most talked-about languages in 2019/20. It allows you to write one codebase for several devices/operating Systems. I don't wanna say to much on this website since it is public and everybody could try to steal our next billion dollar company (hmm... not happening :)), but basically it helps people connect and to stay in touch.

### The Team

> We are currently a team of two guys.
>
> * 1 Backend
> * 1 Frontend
>
> I am doing the frontend part.

### Achievements

> After two weeks of coding (3-6 hours a day #ItsCoronaTimeAndWeGotNothingToDo) I would say we now understand the basics of multi cross app development. While my friend is working on the backend part, and made it possible to get users logged in with different options to save there information in a database, I was working on all the different screens and the User Experience. For the Backend part to save usernames and their informations in a database, we use Googles Firebase system.

Stay tuned for more updates. If you want to see a demo we can arrange a call anytime.

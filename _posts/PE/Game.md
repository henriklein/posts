Group game

## Assigment to invent a Game

---

- Our drill gives you better skills in passing and receiving the ring and also in catching it from your enemy
- To show you how it works we need 3 voluntaries.
- For this game, u need to be at least 4 players in a group, three are standing outside, and one player is in the middle.
- The three players outside have to try to pass the ring to each other so that the person in the middle is not able to get the ball. The person in the inside has to try to catch the ball while the ring is passed. 
- After the inside man caught the ring, the person who had the ring before need to take his place in the middle.
- after two minutes we give a signal to rotate the game if the setting hasnâ€™t change

Groups for 4

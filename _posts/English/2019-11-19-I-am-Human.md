# I am Human

#### poetry assigment

---

I am a lover of being surrounded by other people

But I am also a kid of person that likes to be alone

I like to get things done alone 

Because I don’t trust other people handling important stuff



I am selfish 

I am weak

 I am Overwhelmed but

I am foresighted



I want to make a difference in this dull world

I want to work something important out that helps humanity getting further

I want to meet Steve Jobs again, even if he’s dead

I want to be the first person on Mars

And I want to be like Elon Musk



But right now:

I am a nerd

But I am a bad student

I am ambitious 

But I am failing the whole time

 I am a questioner

 Who is trying to get answers for the reason of everything 



I am a German, 

But I can’t be a patriot

I am asking for a way to solve famine

But I get no answers

I am trying to understand war

But I’m speechless 



But al least

I want to be somebody

I want to be loved

I am Human

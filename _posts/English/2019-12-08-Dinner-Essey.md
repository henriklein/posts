What is our life for? That’s one of the main questions everyone is often thinking about. At the moment we don’t know the reason, and probably we will never know. But three people helped humanity to get closer to the answer. Thanks to Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk we know more than ever before.

## Steve Jobs

One of my biggest dreams would be to get to know Steve Jobs, but unfortunately, he’s dead. He was one of the most significant inventors of the 20th and 21st Century. Without him, we would probably have never seen something like a smartphone. Without him, you wouldn’t have a mouse beside your keyboard, or anything like a “Desktop” or “Bin” on your computer. When he was born in 1955, his 23-year-old mother gave him up for adoption. His “real” parents, as Jobs called them, adopted him in 1957. Even though his parents weren’t academics, they made it possible for him to go to college, which was really important for his birth parents. But after one semester, Jobs left college and started working at Atari in 1974, where he got known by many influential people. Later in the same year, he started working together with a friend on a job for a big company. After finishing the project, he only acknowledged his colleague by just giving him one 10th of the payment. Some people might call him a criminal person. He also tricked out AT&T later with John Draper, by building the “BlueBox.” This machine made it possible for users to call everybody in the whole world for free. Jobs, who dealt with the users and the selling, received more than 20,000 USD out of this crime. With this money, he founded his first company out of his garage, called Apple. The name of Apple was chosen wisely. The wanted to have his name stand ahead of his competitor, AT&T, in the address book. He made it possible to allow non-specialists to interact with computers. Especially with the Macintosh series, he gets people to come closer with computers. He made professionals like teachers or bankers buy one of those high-priced machines by reinventing the way how they work or communicate. With all these technical break-throughs, I discussed, it is obviously, that he has a seat at my exclusive dinner. Although Steve Jobs wasn’t a scientist or cosmologist, you might think that he isn’t chosen wisely for this list. This might sound logical, but it isn’t. Without him, Space-Missions would be much more difficult, and returning rockets, like Elon Musk, invented them, impossible. He is a perplexing person. If I were able to ask him some questions, I wouldn’t know what to ask. He was one of those persons who move humanity much further ahead. A world without his inventions is inconceivable for us.

## Elon Musk

Elon Musk, also known as the “real” Tony Stark is one of the most engaging people in the World and market leader in many areas. With his revolutionary cars, trains, and rockets, he made travelling faster and more secure. Born in a wealthy family in Pretoria, South Africa, he was one of the people “nobody wanted to be.” As a typical outsider, he didn’t have many friends. After his graduation as Valedictorian, he went to Canada’s Queen’s University. Two years later he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where he received an economics degree and a degree in Physics. In 1995 he began a Ph.D. in Applied Physics and Material Science, But after two days he left to start an entrepreneurial career. He founded more than 26 companies in the last 20 years. He is known for companies like X.com (later Paypal), Tesla, Hyperloop, Neuralink and, SolarCity and SpaceX he is one of the greatest inventors of the 21st. Century. His mission, as he says, is to save the world and humanity. By reducing the CO2 output with renewable transport-systems like Tesla, Hyperloop or The Boring Company, he is trying his best to save the world. But what is if our world is not saveable anymore? For this case, Musk works to colonise humanity on other planets like Mars or someday on Kepler-452b, an Earth-sized planet, with acceptable temperatures and water. At this moment, his company is working on launching the first cargo-mission to Mars in 2022, and the first crewed flight in 2024. By doing Terraforming, he wants to make the mars acceptable and breathable for humans in less than 100 years. MarsCity, as his Base will be called, will be opened for every Scientist and technician, “who wants to be part of something bigger.” Because of his reusable rockets, the costs for the missions are just limited to fuel and food. He is the kind of person that gets things done. He renounced his own life for the society and works continuously on one of his many Ideas to save all of us from ourselves.

## Jeff Bezos

Jeff Bezos is an American technical based investor and inventor. He is founder, of Blue Origin, CEO and president of Amazon and owner of the Washington Post. Bezos was born in New Mexico and raised up in Texas. He graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science. In 1994 he founded one of the most successful companies, called Amazon. Amazon was one of its first online book-shops in the world. That helped him expand his company pretty fast to not just an online-book-shop, but also a video-/music-cloud-based service, that gets users the possibility to download films and music fast and easy. While Amazon was growing up, Bezos became richer and richer. In 2000, Bezos invested the most of his money into a “privately funded aerospace manufacturer” called Blue Origin. With the PM2, which was invented and tested in 2011, Bezos worked together with Nasa and carried some cargo-rockets with food and other objects to the ISS. Thanks to Nasa, Blue Origin made a lot of money out of those missions, and Bezos started thinking about leaving the world. But not like Elon Musk, who wants to colonize planets, Bezos plans to build huge “Space-ships” that can carry more than 10.000 people and put them into the suns orbit. To get a better idea of what we are talking about, I put a picture on the last page. In my opinion, his plan won’t work. And I’m not the only person thinking like that. Elon Musk said live, that in his opinion Bezos plan “makes no sense at all.” It is a way too difficult, do get a ship this huge into space, and of course, it’s not very efficient. What if there is a leak? Is everybody going to die? Some people might say that he has seen too many Star Trek or Star Wars. If I had the honour to meet him, I would ask him why he is trying to make something so difficult. I would try to convince him to start colonizing a planet instead of empty space.

Finally, it can be said that every character is chosen wisely. Every one of the three men helped humanity to get further ahead in similar areas. With these guys sitting together at supper it will be probably an unforgettable evening with nice discussions!

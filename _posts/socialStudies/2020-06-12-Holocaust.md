a compact comment about Hitlers' realizations on how to systematically kill millions of ordinary people and its similarities to modern politicians



## introduction

I am ashamed of being German. Seeing those videos and texts make disguises me in a way I can't express in words. It isn't my first time dealing with the darkest of German history, but every time it changes my thinking of what humans are capable of. Honestly, I don't know where to start. I cloud start about the fact that blaming or killing a single group of people for economic and political issues, what matters has nothing to do with them, is a simple and strategically well accessible way to explain complex problems to the public.

Of course, it doesn't help to gain solutions and is entirely unfair. Now we could say that humanity learned from those brutal, unhuman mistakes, but unfortunately, mistakes happen again. In the last three centuries, people have been put in social groups due to their skin colour or nationality. In recent years, US President Trump blamed Mexicans for the high amount of crimes and lousy economy, and as we just had to witness, racism, unfortunately, is still a thing. Please don't get me wrong, I am not trying to change the subject, but we have to get a bigger picture of how it could get so far.

## background

After WW1, Germany suffered a lot. Winners make history, and since Germany lost the First World War, they not only had to rebuild an entire country but also pay extremely high repair costs to other countries. To do so, they inflated the "Reichsmark" that devalued everybody's money by the factor of 100.000. To motivate citizens, they started blaming a group of "outsiders," spreading rumours and making society aggressive. It could have been Buddhists or any kind of nation, but the Nazis chose the Jewish people as a useful target.

Slowly, but continuously, Jewish people were bullied and pressured until they were no more accepted by society. Ghettos were build to exclude Jews from the "arisch" citizen.

## preparation

Adolf Hitler was obsessed with Jews. He made them accountable for the war; consequently, "The destruction of the Jews must be its necessary outcome" (Reich Minister of Propaganda noted in his diary). His goal was to eliminate the Jewish "race" since they were "fraudulent and dishonest."

Since killing millions of people with bullets was in Hitler's sight extremely expensive and inefficient, they researched a way to minimize cost and expenditure efforts. They came up with what they called the final solution of the Jewish question realizing Hitler's thought. "Konzentrationslager" were built, which forked not only Jews but all kinds of political enemies or victims into compete overloaded camps giving them to choose between instant death or working to end. They were to operate outside, in coal mines, rock quarries, construction projects and many more.

## surviving

Those prisoners were treated in an unhuman way losing all privileges and humans rights. A survivor explained that to stay alive, they needed to reduce basic needs to a point, there is no difference between a human and a monkey. Those basic needs were food, water and sleep. Assuming that the Nazis provided those three needs to stay alive is common sense, but not infrequently, prisoners didn't get anything to eat for days. To survive, they formed groups with companions in each employed field, helping each other by providing what needed. A german saying states, "Eine Hand wäscht die Andere," which means that one hand washes the other. "Those companionships were required, and without them [they] [...] couldn't have survived", the same survivor said. People died on a daily base. Working 16 hours a day, having no food or water, sleeping at night with eight others in a bed, having no blanket in winter, is brutal. But those are the only physical miseries. Some people committed suicide, trying to end whatever life that was. To stay alive, they had to blur everything they saw.

## execution

Not everybody got the privilege to work. At the beginning of the camp, newbies were divided into whether they are worth it to work or to get rid of directly. The selection was about age, fitness and race. Kids under 12, adults over 40 or for example, a single mother with multiple kids, directly got send to death. The Nazis, on average, killed more than 50 % of all newcomers before they even entered the camp. To kill all those souls, they needed to find an efficient, cheap solution that ended up being gas chambers. Personages that were to die were told to go to the Sauna, a rewarding place for their hard work and effort, to shower themself, to enjoy themself. They were told to remember where they left their belongings, were given a soap and sometimes towels, just to avoid the guess of something being off. Nobody ever knew what happened in those Saunas, since nobody ever came out to warn. Once in, the only way out is due to death—they then got burned or buried. Nobody knows how many people died since all documents and all prove were destroyed before the end of the war.

## conclusion

Between 1941 and 1945, more than 1 million Jews were killed only in [Auschwitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp) and more than six million Jews in the whole Holocaust. To get an idea of those numbers, the building that hosted the Superbowl last year holds 75.000 fans. If we wanted to fill out the Super Bowl arena with each soul that died during this process, we would need to expand the stadium by the factor of 80. Eighty times the Super Bowl completely sold out...

That's the number of Jews who got killed within four years. We have to make sure that events like this won't happen again in the future. It is necessary, to teach those stories by heart and internalize what happened, so that next time we see a mass-murdering and believe me, we will, humanity won't look away.

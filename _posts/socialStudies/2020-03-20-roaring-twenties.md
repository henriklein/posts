The time after the first world War was a great time, most people enjoyed. Men and Women went out dancing, seeing movies and did other stuff to enjoy themselves. After the brutal time in WW1, many soldiers were happy to be alive, and finally made dreams come true.    

> ## How women advanced their status during the First World War
>
> During World War One, many women became the chance to finally participate in science, universities, factories and many other areas that had been "man only". 
>
> After the first men got sent oversee, society realised that there are not enough man, to handle all jobs that had to be done!  Women were conscripted to fill empty jobs left behind by the male servicemen, producing weapons, bullets and more stuff for their soldiers fighting in Europe. They ran their local fames and started getting accepted more and more in their society. 
>
> Even if the jobs  were taken away after demobilisation, women learned skills and independence and gained the vote within a few years of the war's end. I got a related article about that. Click [here](http://henriklein.org/socialstudies/Theresa-Casgrain).

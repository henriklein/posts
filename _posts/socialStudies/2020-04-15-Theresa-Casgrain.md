 Thérèse Casgrain was a reformer, activist, feminist and politician.

 Thérèse Casgrain was the first woman to lead a provincial political party in Canada. She was politically influenced by her father, a Member of Parliament, who did introduce her to the dedicated and rich. Her interest grew when she married a liberal politician and actively helped with his campaign in the 1920s.

 Later she was elected President of the Ligue des droits de la femme, that focused on a range of women’s issues in Quebec. She established the Ligue de la jeunesse féminine to involve young Quebec women in social work. This happend between school and getting married. After years of hard political but also busy years she gained women right to vote on  April 25, 1945.

  After that point Thérèse expanded her knowledge of work. She ran for Parliament as a liberal candidate in 1942, but lost the election. In 1951, Thérèse won the provincial party presidency of the Party social démocratique du Québec, making her the first woman being allowed to lead a political party in Canada. She kept this position until 1957.

 She also founded:
 * The League of Human Rights in 1960
 * The Quebec branch of the Voice of Women (protesting group against nuclear weapons )
 * The Federation des femmes du Quebec in 1966

 In 1970, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed Thérèse to the Senate. Even though she was already 74 by the appointed she didn't stop working until she was forced to retirement one year later.

 Finally it can be said that Thérèse Casgrain was strongly using the government and politicians to achieve change for the common good. She believed in equally, therefore she fought not just for women rights, but also to achieve Canadas recognition from England and France as an independent Country.

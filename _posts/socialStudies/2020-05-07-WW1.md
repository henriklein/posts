## Schliefenplan

### Definition of the Schliefenplan

The Schlieffen Plan was Germany's tactic on how to win a two-front war, against French and Russia. Since Germany is entirely surrounded by other countries and not isolated, that came already up with an idea already in 1905 on how to win a war with multiple enemies from different sides. The plan was to infiltrate French by going through Belgium to surprise them from their backs. After rushing French, they hoped to be back in Germany to defend itself from Russia 

### Why did the Schliefenplan not work?

As planned, the French expected the Germans attacking straight through the border so they prepared for that. Unfortunately, from Germany's perspective, Belgium didn't let them pass without a fight, but instead, they blew up their bridges and train rails in order to slow German soldiers down. Inserted of two days, the German soldiers took nearly to weeks to arrive in French. As a result of that, the French had enough time to change their position and the battlefield. Germany lost its surprising moment and the thanks to that the whole plan since they haven't had enough time to be back for Russia as expected.

## Mental Health

### How did the War change Men?

At the beginning of the war, many solideres from all sides signed up and volunteered for the army. Most of them didn’t know then, what they had to expect. They went because of they wanted to be a “man”. Men who didn’t go were told as week or traitors. Most of the men who went didn’t expect to actually kill somebody. They thought to be home by Christmas being able to tell lots of adventures stories. But after the first days at the front, solideres quickly realised, that it was not fun. That it wasn’t about telling stories on Christmas. It was about killing each other. They saw the seamless concept behind the war getting men to fight each other even thought they don’t even know each other. They saw fiends dying every day, and that had made their mental healthiness sick as hell. Most of them thought is would be just a better of time until they die.

### Modern Communication in World War 1

At the outbreak of WWI each side had many different communication options. Non-electrical systems of communication such as carrier pigeons and dispatch riders were used alongside and sometime interchangeably with modern communication systems such as the telephone and wireless telegraphy.

### The Impact of a new weapon?

Being informed is one of the most important ability to win a battle or war. You can use a flamethrower for direct impact and kill somebody. But thanks to fast communication you can plan and execute an attack way better and accurately than by guessing. Even though a telephone, for example, is not a direct weapon you can kill somebody with and the chance of interception was pretty high, it was one of the most important tools in a war. 

### How did it work?

Thanks to modern tech at that time (today we can just laugh about it) generals were able to talk to each other, giving and accepting orders. During the war airplanes were first equipped with signal flags to communicate with other airplanes.By the end of the war airplanes got equipped with radio telephones to communicate over short distances with other planes to plan an attack or exchange informations. Airplanes could communicate over long distances with ground wireless stations.

Most Phones back then worked with a big satellite and at least three soldiers had been used to make it working.

### The problem with communication

New inventions often bring great problems. One of the biggest problems was that many countries back then didn't encrypt and used coded communication leaving some strategies to be intercepted by other countries!

Since phones were new technology and not widely spread, it was really expensive and difficult to use.

## Billy Bishop

### Introduction

Billy Bishop was a Canadian pilot for the army who shutdown more than 80 german fighters.

### Was Billy Bishop a Hero?

First of all I have to say that I do not have a neutral position on this topic. I am not a supporter of the war. Dosen't matter which war or on which side.

Of course, Billy Bishop did the best he could do for the allies, but in my opinion he didn't have to kill everybody that crossed his path. The opposition are also humans too, and basically have nothing to do with the war, but getting orders they *have* to follow. 

Flying down to a German airbase just to kill opponents wrong. Even if they are not attacking or don't have anything to do with the war. He might have been seen in 1916 as a hero. But from todays view it is not just about killing people. It's about being kind towards other people. Killing opponents that are done with the war and fleeing, is seen by most people today as a warrior or killer. 

In my opinion he was a huge success for the allies, but on a human level, I think he was repulsive!

## League of Nations - Effective or not?

The League was a good idea but poorly implemented. The Idea of having a worldwide Nation trying to gain peace is good. But not having any resources or not being respected by other nations, there is no difference between the League of Nations and the uncle sitting on the couch watching football, talking about what players could do better and how he would have shot the ball... I think you get an idea of what I mean. Also, who would be allowed to use "peace forces "? How can a group of guys decide about what's right and not? Surely, in terms of human crimes, they could be activated, but in normal daily usage, they would have to choose a side you support, which is often not fair. Today we got green hats, controlled by the UNO, doing excels what has been disused. There are rules in place, telling exactly in what cases greenhearts are allowed to intervene, and when not. Typically, green hats being in war-areas, they don't intercept at all. They support mostly both sides medically, creating infrastructure to hospitals or organizing food and water. In an (unlikely) event of a crime against human rights, for example, killing civilians on purpose, destroying enemy hospitals or Kindergarten (Happened before), they are allowed to intercept and defend the attacked ones.

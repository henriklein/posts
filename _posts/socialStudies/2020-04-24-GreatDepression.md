### Economic Dependence on Exports (economy)

+ Too much wheat and newsprint produced
+ Canada exported 80% of wheat before 1920, after that the USA, and later Argentina and Australia concurrent with Canada and lowered the price.

### US Protectionism (politics)

+ Since Canada was now more dependent on the USA, they were able to set higher tariffs and priced for importing/exporting goods.
+ This action led other countries to do the same -> lowing profit and creating slowdowns for everybody

### Unemployment (society)

+ Since many companies and countries are now battling down prices, the gain for employees got shorten, and many got fired.
+ Regarding an article from 1997 (no Name labelled), society still behaved like having no understanding of the unemployed and their issues. They got seen as criminals and lazy beings.

## Stocks impact to the Great Depression

### the crash of the stock market

One of the most significant impacts on the Great Depression was the stock market crash.

It was an unpredictable time for investments. Investors didn't want to take risks by investing in companies that would probably fail occasioned by the financial and political situation back then. First sold off their stocks to spend their money rather on food or other foreign currencies like gold or diamonds, than on as pointed out instable assets.

After the first started selling their stocks, the stock market run down, what got even more peoples to sell their shares. That was a vicious circle until no company that was on the market and trading stocks was worth any more money. That caused society's but also economic poorness since the wealth of a nation and its human beings face society's economy.

## Responses after collation

### Policys used after GD to regain wealth

After The First World War, people got depressed and frustrated. That caused some events pointed out earlier. As when in 1929 the stock market crashed, the economic impact over-rolled every nation worldwide and ruined years of climbing wealth.

### communism

In *Russia*, The great depression, however, helped Stalin to keep on power. He introduced his "Five Year Plan" planned economy, which allowed the government to force industrialization and collectivization of farmers. This was the start of what later became known as a communism-state.

### isolationism

The USA became during the 1930s, after the First World War and the Great Depression, and isolationism state. It means to support non-involvement in European conflicts and to do not in international politics. It focuses on countries' wealth and keeps imports way lower than exports to reestablished contours wealth.

### totalitarianism

Totalitarianism is a policy that helps countries to control the economy instead of having a free market.

It restricts individual opposition to the state and exercises a high degree of control over public and private life. Totalitarianism was and is used in many different Cultures. After the GD, it was used in Germany, Russia, Italy and China. Under Hitler, the strategy for recovery was to ignore free-market liberalism.

### nationalism

Nationalism was used by many Countries and Leaders after the Great depression to assert nation's best interests by keeping the affairs of other countries at a distance. It was used by the USA, which got Canada into trouble.  

### fascism

fascism seems being related to communism. Benito Mussolini used it in Italy. He used people's angriness and their frustration for his own good by telling them stories and giving them one enemy they can make responsible for their miserable situation. It was also used in Germany to reinforce the army.

### Imperialism

Imperialism is a policy that forces somebody willing by using weapons or another kind of blackmail. After WW1 and the Great Depression, Germany spent lots of money to get a bigger military. Back then the government did offend the Versailles treaty, and lied about his usage.
